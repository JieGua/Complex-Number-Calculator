# Complex-Number-Calculator

## Introduction
This calculator can support up to three levels of math operations in complex number:
1. Addition (+), Subtruction (-)
2. Multiplication (*), Division (/)
3. Power (^) (Note: power function with complex number as exponent is considered as math error in this program)

Also, it can support two output formats for complex number:
1. Standard form
2. Polar form

## Setup
1. If you are using Windows, you can either use the exe file provided or download the source code to compile it yourself.
2. If you are using Mac, please download the source code and compile it yourself.

## Usage
1. Exactly the way how you normally use the scientific calculator, type in a formula and enter it to see the result!  
(Note: use i for the imaginary part)  
```
Here is an example : (1+i)*(1-i)-20.5/2^3
```
2. Commands:
   - Enter S to change output form to standard form (Default)
   - Enter P to change output form to polar form
   - Enter esc to exit the program
